That year was a rough year for the animals. They worked like slaves under Napoleon. The winmill was having difficulties. All materials were at hand but none of the animals were able to break the stone. This years harvest was a little less successfull. Boxer was the hardest working and was beggining to strain his muscles and began to get weaker and weaker. He would not listen to the people who told him to stop. His two slogans were, "I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always right". Now the pigs were acting as humans and slowly breaking rules of the seven commandments. One night there was a crazy storm which blew down the windmill and Napoleon blames it on SNOWBALL. Whoever finds him dead will get half a bushel of apples and whoever finds him alive will get a full bushel of apples.
