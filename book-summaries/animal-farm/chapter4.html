 <p> All around the country was how the animals took the farm. All the farmers were scared that it would happen to them. All the animals were also singing "Beasts of England". Jones had come back to take over the farm. He had multiple men and one gun amongst the men. Snowball had a plan from the books that he had read. They all attact the men and then retreated. But it was a trick. Boxer and a couple of cows came out and knocked out the men. One of the sheep died and was awarded "Animal Hero, First Class". At the end, the animals won and it was a big celebration. Snowball was shot in the leg and was bleeding. </p>
