 <h2>General</h2>
 <p>Boxer and Clover were two of the three horses on the farm and they knew everything about the farm. Now, the pigs were the ones solving all the difficulties. This year was the biggest harvest that was ever completed in the history of the farm. All animals finally made their own food and ate a lot. Boxer was the amiration of the farm. He was always hard working and said the most motivating things. There was work for every animal on the farm but Mollie and the cats were always missing during work hours. Ever since the Rebellion, Old Ben the donkey was unchanged since the Rebellion and still slow. He would always say a quote to his opinion on Jones's leave. On Sundays were days of rest. Green flags were put up to represent the Republic of Animals. Almost all the animals learned to read and write. Jessie and Bluebell had 9 puppies and Napoleon took all of them to educate them. Because all the pigs were the brains of the farm they got all the apples and milk to stay healthy.</p>
