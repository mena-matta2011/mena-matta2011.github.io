<p>Mollie the horse is seen with a human and later disappears to find a better life. Now Snowball and Napoleon are having problems making up there minds and consistantly arguing just to make sure the other person does not get what they want. One of the things that Snowball wanted was to build a windmill that created electricity so that ther were noi animal labour. Napoleon did not want this and gave no comprimise to the suggestion. One argument, Napoleon unleashed his nine dogs that he raised when he took them from Jessie and Bluebell. These dogs chased snowball to a random room on the farm and they almost ate him.Napoleon now says that he is the leader of the farm. Later, Napoleon had the idea to build the windmill.
