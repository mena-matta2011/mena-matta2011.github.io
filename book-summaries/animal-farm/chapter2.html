 <p>Three days later Old Major was found dead in his sleep.The three pigs mentioned talked of Major's teachings and focused on the Rebellion. Farmer Jones was a good farmer until he fell into the evil days. He eventually neglected the farm and drank unhealthy amounts of beer. One day, Mr. Jones got so drunk he forgot to feed the animals. The Rebellion came sooner than expected. The animals broke into the house and got Mr. Jones out of the farm. They were now free. That night was a great sleep for all animals. When they woke up they had realized what great thing they had done the day before and ran aroud the entire property of the farm. The farm was officially theirs. The animals had also changed the name of the farm from Animal Farm to Manor farm</p>
