 <p>Old Major had a dream. He shares to all the animals in the farm
    that animals lives are short. Animals should not
    be used fore slavery just because humans make them. He also says that animals should be free. Old Major notices that Moses the ravine is missing. Old Major claims that if it were not for man they would not be suffering. No animal should do the things of a man even after they conquer them. No animal should kill another animal / all animals are equal. Now his dream was said to be a song that his mother sang and all the animals sang the song in unison and the song sang of freedom to all of England's animals or "Beasts".</p>
